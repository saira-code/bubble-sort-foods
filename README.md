# Bubble Sort - Favorite Foods

## What did you learn while making this app?

I learned how the Bubble Sort algorithm works by comparing and swapping elements step-by-step. I also practiced sorting items based on a custom conditionâ€”in this case, the length of food names.

## What feature did you enjoy building the most?

I enjoyed implementing the swapping logic that lets the program sort the list properly. Seeing the list get ordered correctly was satisfying!

## What would you add next if you had more time?

I would add user input functionality so anyone can enter their own list of items to be sorted. I might also explore other sorting algorithms like Selection Sort or Quick Sort.
